                Lyapunov Exponent of Random Walk in Random Potential
                <br />Explanation: In this dissertation, we prove a shape theorem and
                derive a variational formula for the limiting quenched Lyapunov
                exponent of random walk in a random potential on a square lattice of
                arbitrary dimension and with an arbitrary finite set of steps. The
                potential is a function of a stationary environment and the step of
                the walk. The potential is subject to a moment assumption the
                strictness of which is tied to the mixing of the environment. Our
                setting includes directed and undirected polymers, and random walk in
                static and dynamic random environments. When the temperature is taken
                to zero, our results also give a shape theorem and a variational
                formula for the time constant of both site and edge directed
                last-passage percolation and standard first-passage percolation.

                Disorder regimes of directed polymers: lattice case versus tree case
                <br />Explanation: Relation between disorder regimes of directed
                lattice polymers and tree polymers have been scrutinized in this
                thesis. In the rst part of this thesis we introduced the polymer in
                chemistry and explained our model associated with polymer and two
                basic well-known random walks.In chapter two we will focus on directed
                polymers in random environment model (a.k.a. directed lattice
                polymers). Impurities are randomly distributed in the environment
                where our model is de ned. We want to model polymer chains that are a
                ected by these impurities. By correlating an energy to each polymer
                structure, we select a polymer randomly. The asymptotic behavior of
                the directed polymer (as its length goes to in nity) which depends on
                the dimension of the ambient space and temperature will be analyzed.
                Temperature controls phase transitions of our model. At high
                temperatures it has been observed that the random disorder does not
                have a solid e ect. However, when the temperature is below the
                critical value, polymers move to a phase where the random disorder a
                ects at all. We struggle to improve our understanding of both phases
                on lattices and on trees. Results for a canonical multiplicative
                cascades analogous with tree polymers are established in the third
                part. We compare sharp results that are known for trees with the ones
                known for lattices and try to answer the open problems on lattices
                especially the situation at the critical temperature.

                <b>Boğaziçi University: </b>BSc in Mathematics, 2012 <br />Thesis: The
                Optimal Stopping Problem
                <br>Explanation: In this project, we will
                analyse the so-called secretary problem which is concerned with
                selecting the best among a given number of applicants, on the
                condition that the rejected ones cannot be recalled later. The aim is
                to find the optimal strategy that maximizes the probability of
                choosing the best candidate. We will be interested in a particular
                version of the problem where no information about the applicant
                distribution will be assumed. We will start our analysis by putting
                the problem in the framework of an auxiliary Markov chain with an
                appropriate state space. We will then review the basics of optimal
                stopping theory and write down the Bellman equation corresponding to
                our model. Finally, we will solve this Bellman equation and deduce the
                optimal strategy.
